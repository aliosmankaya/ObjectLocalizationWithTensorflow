# ObjectLocalizationWithTensorflow

### First of all, object detection and object localization are different subject

*In Object Detection, our model can detect multiple objects in an image.*
*In Object Localization, our model can detect just one object in an image. And this is enough for some works.*

*This notebook contains Coursera's "Object Localization with Tensorflow" Guided Project codes by Amit Yadav. and I wanted to add line-by-line comments to the code for better understanding.*
